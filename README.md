# 🐾 FindMyFur: QR Tags That Bring Pets Home


📍 Module 1: Login System
Welcome to FindMyFur, a passion-driven project designed to help reunite lost pets with their owners using smart QR tag technology. This repository documents the module-by-module development of the full web application — starting with the Login System, the foundation for secure user access and pet profile management.


🚀 Project Vision
FindMyFur aims to empower pet owners with a digital platform where they can register their pets, generate QR tags, and track recovery updates. Each module will be released progressively, with this repo serving as a transparent log of development milestones.

This project is not only a tool for pet recovery — it’s also a personal journey to sharpen my full-stack development skills and build a meaningful, real-world solution.
